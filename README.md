## pitch-process

This is a system to process pitch data.

To execute the program run `python3 controller.py <file>`

The main class is located in `processor.py`. There's a `controller.py` where there's a terminal script to enter operations one by one and also a test ingestion function for the `pitch_example_data`.

Finally there's some tests in `tests.py`.

I am assuming Python3 as the language.
